# [Educational DP Contest](https://atcoder.jp/contests/dp)

AtCoder's [Educational DP Contest](https://atcoder.jp/contests/dp) was an educational contest held January 6, 2019 containing Dynamic Programming problems of increasing difficulty.

The explanations I have provided for these problems do require a basic understanding of what dynamic programming is and how it works (mainly the concepts of state and transition). [This](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/solve-dynamic-programming-problem/) is a decent overview, but feel free to Google around and find a resource that works for you.

I do refer to previous problems in some explanations, so if possible, make sure you understand a solution fully before you move on to the next problem.
