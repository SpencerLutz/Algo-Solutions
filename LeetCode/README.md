# [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)

LeetCode is a platform designed for programmers to improve their skill with algorithm problems. It is most frequently used for interview prep, but they also host weekly and bi-weekly programming contests.

I typically answer LeetCode problems with Python. This is primarily due to its simplicity and ease of use in my own interviews/prep, but also because many people viewing LeetCode solutions are also preparing for interviews and want more readable solutions, rather than C++ solutions that would be more valuable for a competitive programming audience.
